          Cyril’s early life was marked by constant struggle. He was often sent
          home from school because his family couldn’t afford the fees. At
          times, even necessities like food were scarce. To survive, Cyril and
          his peers resorted to scavenging for scrap metal to sell. Life became
          even more precarious as he entered adolescence, with many of his
          friends turning to crime, lured by the promise of a flashy lifestyle.
          Tragically, this path often led to fatal outcomes, with young lives
          lost to mob justice or police violence.
